# MapEditor
Map editor for 2D games, made in Java.

Open the src project folder in NetBeans (or some other IDE of your choice) and run the project from there. The dist folder contains 
the built program, but some paths in the project are wrong, so I wouldn't recommend running it from there. The dist folder also has
some documentation in Finnish and the javadoc.
